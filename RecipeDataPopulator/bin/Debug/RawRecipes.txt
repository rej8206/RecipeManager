Put wine, shallots, and crushed garlic in a large pot. Set a steamer basket in pot, add clams, and cover. Bring to a boil, then simmer briskly over medium-high heat until clams open, 5 to 10 minutes.2. Transfer clams to a plate and let cool. Strain broth from pot; set aside 3\/4 cup plus 2 tbsp. and chill. Remove meat from clams, saving 8 shells; chill meat and shells.3. Meanwhile, in a large frying pan over medium heat, saut poblano chile, corn, and pepper in oil until chile is tender-crisp, 7 to 8 minutes. Add minced garlic; cook, stirring, 1 minute. Remove about 2 tbsp. of mixture and set aside.4. Stir masa in a bowl with 2 tbsp. reserved clam broth and 2 tbsp. water. Stir in corn mixture from pan and half of clam meat. Spoon into 8 (4- to 6-oz.) oiled ramekins; smooth tops. Cover each with foil.5. Put a rack in a roasting pan and fill pan with water to just below rack. Set ramekins on rack. Cover pan tightly with foil. Heat over 2 burners on high heat until a little steam escapes; reduce heat to medium-low and cook until tamales feel fairly firm, 35 minutes.6. Meanwhile, in a small frying pan over medium-high heat, cook jalapeos until blackened, turning occasionally, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool, then peel, seed, and dice.7. Boil reserved 3\/4 cup clam broth in a saucepan over medium-high heat until reduced to 1\/3 cup, 5 minutes. Stir in jalapeos. A few minutes before serving, whisk in butter a bit at a time until melted. Stir in remaining clams and heat until warm, then stir in shells.8. Unwrap ramekins; put on plates. Spoon clam sauce on top and set a clamshell on each. Top with reserved poblano chile, cilantro, and Fresno chiles.*Masa for tamales has fat, leavening, and salt added to ground corn.

Using an electric mixer beat the egg whites on medium speed with the cream of tartar and the salt until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes.  Add the sugar and vanilla and beat until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and beat for 2 minutes, scrapping down the sides of the bowl as needed.  Pour the batter into an ungreased angel food cake pan.  Bake until golden brown and springy when touches, 30 to 35 minutes.  (The top of the cake may crack a little.) Remove the pan from the oven and turn it upside down over the neck of a bottle. Let cool completely.

In a large, deep skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil until shimmering. Add the chopped chard stems and cook over moderately high heat, stirring frequently, until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chard leaves and cook, tossing, until wilted, about 3 minutes. Drain the chard and transfer to a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Wipe out the skillet. 2. In a saucepan, bring the stock to a simmer. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in the skillet until shimmering. Add the onion and cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until softened, about 7 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring until the rice is coated with olive oil, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of the hot stock and cook, stirring frequently, until the rice has absorbed most of the stock, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook the risotto, adding 1 cup of stock at a time and stirring constantly between additions until the stock is absorbed. The risotto is done when it is creamy and the rice grains are just tender, about 20 minutes. 3. Remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the cheese, butter and cooked chard. Season with salt and pepper and serve at once. Wine Recommendation: A rich Chianti Classico will echo the creamy texture of the Gouda and soften the sharpness of the greens. Try one from the 1998 vintage, such as the Fontodi or the Vignamaggio.","ketogenic":false,"lowFodmap":false,"readyInMinutes":45,"servings":4,"sourceName":"My Recipes","sourceUrl":"http:\/\/www.myrecipes.com\/recipe\/risotto-with-bitter-greens-goat-gouda-cheese-10000000651046\/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https:\/\/spoonacular.com\/risotto-with-bitter-greens-and-goat-gouda-cheese-308707","sustainable":false,"title":"Risotto with Bitter Greens and Goat Gouda Cheese","vegan":false,"vegetarian":true,"veryHealthy":true,"veryPopular":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":42,"whole30":false}

Stem chiles.                                                                Pur√©e 1 chile (reserve remainder for salsa) in a blender with pineapple, vinegar, oil, garlic, oregano, cumin, and 1 3\/4 tsp salt, then transfer to a bowl.

Broil 4 to 6 inches from heat, turning occasionally, until tomatoes are wilted, skins are blistered, and onions begin to soften and are charred in spots, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer to blender. Add remaining 2 toasted chiles, water, and 1 tsp salt and pur√©e until smooth. Add cilantro and 1\/2 cup pineapple basting sauce and pulse until cilantro is finely chopped.                                                            Make kebabs:                Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (medium-high heat for gas).                                                                Toss pork with half of remaining pineapple basting sauce, then thread pork, onion, and pineapple onto skewers, leaving small spaces between pieces. Put on a tray. Wrap tortillas in 2 separate foil packages.                                                                Oil grill rack, then grill skewers, covered only if using a gas grill, turning and basting frequently with remaining sauce (do not baste during last 3 minutes), until pork is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a platter and keep warm, covered.                                                                Heat tortillas (in foil) on grill, turning once, until warmed through, about 3 minutes total.

                   Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.To make the rhubarb compote: In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring rhubarb, water and sugar to a boil. When sugar is dissolved, lower heat to a simmer and cook until rhubarb is soft, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Puree in a blender until smooth, if necessary. The rhubarb should break down to a smooth compote.To make the brownie batter: In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, Chile powder, cinnamon and salt. Set aside. In a clean microwavable glass bowl, melt bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate together in the microwave at 50 percent power or in a double boiler. Set aside.In a stand mixer, cream butter and sugar on medium speed. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, combining well. Add in the vanilla and rum. Stir the rhubarb into the chocolate mixture, then add to the batter. Mix until combined. Add the flour mixture and mix just until incorporated. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and gently fold in the semisweet chocolate and walnuts. Do not over mix. Spray an 8 by 8 by 2-inch clear glass baking dish with shortening spray. Line bottom with parchment paper, then spray parchment.  Pour batter into the prepared pan and smooth out top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.  Cut into squares and serve.

Marinate truffle circles, covered and chilled, 1 hour, or until ready to use.                                                                While truffle circles are marinating, cover quail eggs with water by 1 inch in a small saucepan. Simmer, covered, 5 minutes, then refresh under cold water to stop cooking. Peel eggs and halve lengthwise.                                                                Carefully push out yolks and mash with chives, minced truffles (and any juice if using preserved truffles), and remaining vinaigrette to create a paste. Season with salt and pepper and transfer mixture to pastry bag fitted with tip. Chill deviled yolks in bag until ready to use.                                                                Arrange egg white halves on a platter and pipe in just enough deviled yolks to fill holes (do not mound). Cover each yolk with a truffle circle.                                                            Cooks' notes:            ¬∑Truffles, vinaigrette, egg white halves, and deviled yolks may be prepared 1 day ahead and chilled separately. (Cover whites with plastic wrap.)¬∑Although best assembled right before serving, hors d'oeuvres can be chilled, covered with plastic wrap, up to 2 hours.","ketogenic":false,"lowFodmap":true,"readyInMinutes":120,"servings":48,"sourceName":"Epicurious","sourceUrl":"http:\/\/www.epicurious.com:80\/recipes\/food\/views\/Truffled-Quail-Eggs-104380","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https:\/\/spoonacular.com\/truffled-quail-eggs-214150","sustainable":false,"title":"Truffled Quail Eggs","vegan":false,"vegetarian":true,"veryHealthy":false,"veryPopular":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":0,"whole30":true}

Dumplings: In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg white, sesame oil and arrowroot until frothy. Stir in the bell pepper, carrot, peas, chives, ginger, salt, and shrimp. Put 1\/2 of the mixture in a food processor. Blend until the mixture forms a chunky paste. Return the paste to the bowl and combine it with the remaining vegetable mixture. Cut each egg roll wrapper into 4 equal-sized squares. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the mixture into the center of each piece of dough. Gather the sides of the egg roll wrapper around the filling leaving the top of the filling uncovered.  If necessary, use a little water to help secure the wrapper in place. Spray the bottom of a bamboo or stainless steel steamer with vegetable oil cooking spray. Working in batches, stand the dumplings, uncovered filling side up, in the steamer and cover. Steam until the shrimp turn pink and are cooked through, about 6 to 8 minutes.Dipping sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, honey, hot sauce and garlic. Arrange the dumplings on a platter and serve the dipping sauce alongside.

Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand until ready to serve.Meanwhile, cut off a 2-inch piece of the pineapple and grate it on the coarse holes of a box grater into a large bowl. Stir in the ginger, vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1\/4 teaspoon five-spice powder. Add the scallions and pork chops and turn to coat; let marinate at room temperature, 10 minutes. Rub the remaining pineapple with the remaining 1\/4 teaspoon five-spice powder.Preheat a grill to medium high. Grill the pork chops until just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Grill the scallions and pineapple, turning occasionally, until charred, about 3 minutes.Roughly chop the pineapple and scallions and transfer to a bowl. Add the red pepper flakes and a splash of soy sauce and toss.

Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 20 minutes; drain. When they are cool enough to handle but still hot, carefully cut the potatoes in half (try not to pull off the skins) and transfer to a large bowl. Finely chop the garlic and add it to the potatoes along with 2 tablespoons each vinegar and olive oil; season with salt. (It is important to do this while the potatoes are still warm so they absorb the vinegar and oil and are seasoned all the way through.)Meanwhile, bring another pot of well-salted water to a boil over medium heat. Set up a bowl of ice water and season it generously with salt. Add the haricots verts to the boiling water and cook until tender, 5 to 6 minutes (bite a bean to be sure they are properly cooked); drain and immediately put in the ice water to \"shock\" them, or stop the cooking. When they are cold, drain the haricots verts and let them dry a little. Cut them in half.Add the haricots verts, olives, oregano, scallions and red pepper flakes to the bowl with the potatoes. Stir to combine well; taste and adjust the seasoning. Add the remaining oil and vinegar, if needed. This salad is good now, but it will be even better if you let it sit for at least 1 hour at room temperature.Photograph by Anna Williams                                                    Recipe courtesy of Anne Burrell for Food Network Magazine.
