	"Mix together the orange juice, lemon juice, lime juice, salt, black pepper, thyme, garlic, ginger, habanero pepper, curry powder, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon in a bowl. Whisk in the vegetable oil. Pour 3/4 of the marinade into a resealable plastic zipper bag, and place the chicken wing pieces into the bag. Squeeze out any air, and mix the wing pieces with the marinade, and refrigerate from 4 to 12 hours. Place the remaining 1/4 of the marinade in a small bowl, and refrigerate until grilling time.                            Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.                            Remove the wing pieces from the bag of marinade, and discard the used marinade. Sprinkle the wings with salt and pepper to taste, and sear on the hottest part of the grill until the wings begin to brown, about 4 minutes per side.                            Move the wings to a less-hot part of the grill, baste with the unused portion of the marinade, and close the grill. Grill until the wings are golden brown, show good grill marks, are no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 more minutes. Baste again with marinade and turn after 5 to 8 minutes.                                                Kitchen-Friendly View",

	"Directions                    Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        For the turkey: Four days before service, place the salt, sage, thyme, black peppercorns, and allspice into a spice grinder and pulse until the peppercorns and allspice are coarsely ground, 5 to 6 pulses. Set aside.Set the turkey, breast-side down, on a large cutting board with the tail closest to you. Use an electric knife or heavy-duty kitchen shears to cut up one side of the backbone. Turn the bird around and cut back down the other side of the spine. Reserve the backbone for Giblet Stock. Discard any fat pockets or excess skin found inside the turkey. Turn the turkey breast-side up and use the heel of your hands to press down on both breasts, until you hear a cracking sound and the bird has flattened slightly.Rub the seasoned salt on both sides of the turkey. Place the turkey on a parchment paper lined half sheet pan, breast-side up with legs running with the long side of the pan. Store, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 4 days.Remove the turkey from the refrigerator and leave at room temperature for 1 hour.For the panzanella: Place the parsnips and rutabaga in a large nonstick roasting pan, toss with vegetable oil and set aside.Place one rack in the middle of the oven and a second one far enough below so the roasting pan will fit. Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.Place the turkey directly on the middle rack of the oven with the legs perpendicular to the metal bars of the rack. Place the roasting pan with the parsnips and rutabaga on the rack below the turkey and roast both for 30 minutes.Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. Add the red onion to the roasting vegetables and stir to combine. Continue to roast both the vegetables and the turkey until a probe thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 155 degrees F, an additional 40 to 50 minutes.Remove the turkey from the oven onto a cooling rack set inside a half sheet pan and rest for 30 minutes.Add the Brussels sprouts, bread cubes and garlic to the roasting vegetables, stir to combine and roast for an additional 15 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the oven and immediately transfer to a serving bowl. Pour the apple cider vinegar in the warm roasting pan, stir and scrape off any browned bits from the pan. Pour the vinegar mixture over the salad, add the thyme and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper as desired. Serve warm or at room temperature.Carve the turkey with an electric knife and serve with the panzanella.

	"Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander until the water runs clear. Combine the rice with water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low; cover and simmer until rice is tender, 12 to 14 minutes. Spread cooked rice onto a baking sheet to cool. Season with 1 tablespoon of sesame oil and salt.                            While the rice is simmering, pour the eggs into a skillet over medium-high heat and allow to cook without stirring or turning to get a flat layer of cooked egg. When egg is completely cooked, remove from skillet and set aside on a cutting board to cool.                            Separate the nori sheets onto a flat surface and divide the cooled rice between them, leaving only a half-inch strip of seaweed visible at the top of each sheet. Arrange strips of egg, cucumber, carrot, cheese, and ham in thin layers on top of the rice. Beginning with the bottom of each sheet of nori, use a bamboo sushi mat to firmly roll each piece into a cylindrical shape. Brush each roll with 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil and cut into six even pieces.                                                Kitchen-Friendly View",

Bring to a boil and add the eggplant. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggplant is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the eggplant in a colander, reserving 1 to 2 cups of the cooking liquid separately. Allow eggplant to continue to drain while you proceed.Return the same Dutch oven to the heat and add the olive oil. When hot, add the onion, bell pepper and celery and cook, stirring, until very soft, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic, ground beef and tasso and cook, stirring to break up the meat, until the meat is brown, about 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste, Essence, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and cayenne pepper and cook for 2 minutes, stirring. Add the reserved eggplant, ham, and 1 cup of the reserved eggplant cooking liquid and stir gently to combine. Cook for 5 minutes. The mixture should be moist but not soupy. If it seems too dry, add a bit more of the reserved cooking liquid. In a small bowl combine the heavy cream, eggs, and green onions and add to the eggplant, along with 3/4 cup of the bread crumbs. Stir gently to combine.Transfer to a 9-by-13-inch casserole and sprinkle with the remaining bread crumbs. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until bubbly around the edges and lightly golden on top.Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.Emeril's ESSENCE Creole Seasoning (also referred to as Bayou Blast):                                                            Combine all ingredients thoroughly.Yield: 2/3 cupRecipe from \"New New Orleans Cooking\", by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie TirschPublished by William Morrow, 1993.

	"Lightly spoon flours into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine water and potato in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook for 15 minutes or until tender. Place mixture in a blender; process until smooth. Reserve 1 1/2 cups potato liquid; discard the remaining potato liquid. Cool the potato liquid to warm (100 to 110). Combine 1 cup bread flour, potato liquid, and yeast in a large bowl. Cover and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.Add whole-wheat flour, honey, oil, and salt to yeast mixture. Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes); add enough of remaining bread flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent the dough from sticking to hands (the dough will feel tacky). Place dough into a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise 30 minutes or until doubled in size. (Press two fingers into dough. If indentation remains, the dough has risen enough.)Preheat oven to 375.Uncover dough; brush egg white over loaf. Sprinkle dough with pumpkin seed and sunflower-seed kernels. Bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pan; cool on a wire rack.",

	"Preparation                                        For topping:                Blend sugar,cocoa powder, and cinnamon in small bowl.                                                            For filling:                Whisk sugar, flour, and espresso powder in heavy medium saucepan to blend. Gradually add milk, whisking until smooth. Whisk in yolks and salt. Add butter. Cook over medium-high heat until pastry cream thickens and boils, whisking constantly, about 6 minutes. Whisk in vanilla. Transfer to small bowl. Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of filling. Chill until cold, at least 4 hours and up to 2 days.                                                            For doughnuts:                Combine yeast and 1/4 teaspoon sugar in large bowl of heavy-duty mixer. Pour warm milk over and stir to blend. Let stand until yeast dissolves and mixture bubbles, about 10 minutes.                                                                Meanwhile, whisk flour, cinnamon, salt, and 1/4 cup sugar in medium bowl to blend. Whisk butter and eggs in another medium bowl to blend.                                                                Butter large bowl. Using dough-hook attachment, beat butter-egg mixture into yeast mixture on medium-low speed until well blended, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl, about 4 minutes. Beat in flour mixture by 1/4 cupfuls, then beat dough until smooth and beginning to pull away from sides of bowl, about 5 minutes. Scrape dough from hook into bowl. Let dough rest 5 minutes. Scrape dough into buttered bowl (dough will be sticky). Turn dough to coat with butter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough overnight.Sprinkle 2 baking sheets lightly with flour. Gently press dough to deflate. Roll out chilled dough on lightly floured surface to 1/3-inch thickness. Using 2 3/4- to 3-inch-diameter round cutter, cut out dough rounds. Transfer rounds to floured sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Gather dough scraps. Roll out to 1/3-inch thickness; cut out more rounds. Repeat until all dough is used. Cover dough rounds on sheets with towels. Let rise in draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.                                                                Line 2 baking sheets with several layers of paper towels. Pour oil into large deep skillet to depth of 1 1/2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 360°F to 370°F. Fry 3 dough rounds at a time until golden brown, adjusting heat to maintain temperature, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Using slotted spoon, transfer doughnuts to paper towels to drain. Dip both sides of warm doughnuts into topping. Transfer to rack and cool completely.                                                                Spoon filling into pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch plain round tip. Push blade of small sharp knife into side of 1 doughnut about 3/4 of the way to opposite side; remove knife. Insert tip of pastry bag into slit and press in filling until center of doughnut bulges. Return doughnut to rack. Repeat with remaining doughnuts. (Doughnuts can be filled up to 2 hours before serving.Let stand at room temperature.)",

	"Heat the oven to 350°F and arrange a rack in the middle. Generously coat the wells of a 12-well muffin pan with butter; set aside.    Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil and the measured butter in a medium frying pan over medium heat until the oil is shimmering and the butter has melted.    Add the diced onion and cook, stirring rarely, until it is a deep golden brown, adjusting the heat as necessary if it starts to brown too much, about 30 minutes. Season well with salt and pepper, add the thyme, and stir to combine. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl.    Meanwhile, clean, trim, and slice the mushrooms 1/2 inch thick; set aside. Crumble the goat cheese into pea-sized pieces and set aside.    Return the frying pan to medium heat, add the remaining tablespoon of oil, and heat until shimmering. Add the sliced mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring rarely, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add to the bowl with the onion. Add the goat cheese to the bowl and stir to evenly combine; set aside.    Place the eggs and milk in a large bowl and whisk until the eggs are broken up and evenly combined with the milk, about 1 minute. Add the measured salt and whisk to combine.    Divide the onion-mushroom-cheese mixture evenly among the wells of the prepared muffin pan. Fill each well almost to the top with the egg mixture.    Bake until each frittata is puffed and the center is just set, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan to a wire rack until it’s cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes (the frittatas will deflate). Run a small knife around the perimeter of each well to loosen and remove the frittatas. Serve warm or at room temperature.",

Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream.                                                    2012 Ree Drummond, All Rights Reserved                         CATEGORIES:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Peach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Dessert                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Cobbler                                                                                                                                                                                                                        View All         <div class=\"popover-content categories\">                        <ul>                    <li>Main Ingredient</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/p/peach-cobbler-recipes.html\">Peach</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Course</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/a/apple-strudel-recipes.html\">Dessert</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Dish</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/c/cobbler.html\">Cobbler</a></li>                                 </ul>                <ul>                    <li>Technique</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"/content/food/topics/b/baking.html\">Baking</a></li>                                 </ul></div>",

Whisk to combine, then stir in the remaining ingredients. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and simmer for 45 minutes, until the sauce is thick and pourable and the flavors have melded. Strain out the solids.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Rub the steak with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill or broil the steaks, turning once, for 7-10 minutes for medium rare, depending on thickness.  Allow to rest for at least 5 minutes, then slice across the grain. Serve with the sauce on the side, or spoon it over.",

Microwave on high until edges of potatoes begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes, shaking bowl (without removing plastic) to redistribute potatoes halfway through cooking.  Alternatively, do not chop them and boil for 8 to 10 minutes, drain, and chop once cool enough to handle.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a 10 or 12-inch skillet over medium heat.

Transfer to small bowl.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Melt remaining tablespoon of butter in now-empty skillet over medium heat. Add potatoes and pack down with spatula. Cook, without moving, until underside of potatoes is brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn potatoes, pack down again, and continue to cook until well browned and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring potatoes every few minutes, until crusty and golden on all sides, 9 to 12 minutes. Stir in onion, seasonings of your choice and salt and pepper to taste.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            When potatoes are about ten minutes off, bring a small pot of water to boil, and add the vinegar.  Turn the heat down to a very gentle simmer and slide the eggs into the water (I use a ladle technique).  Guide the eggs back into a compact shape if needed.  Cook just until the whites are completely set, 3-5 minutes                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Taste the home fries for seasoning, and dust with almost all the paprika.

Drain in a colander, then immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes until cold to stop the cooking process.

	"Directions                    Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        Preheat the grill to high.In a large, nonreactive bowl, combine the lemongrass, ginger, garlic, scallion greens, soy sauce, sesame oil, and honey and whisk well. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.Skewer the shrimp, scallion whites, and red bell peppers onto skewers in whatever order you like. There should be 4 to 6 shrimp per skewer.Place the skewers on a flat plate and drizzle with peanut oil. It is not necessary to salt the skewers because soy sauce has so much salt in it. Place the shrimp skewers on the grill and cook about 3 minutes per side, or just until the shrimp curls, turns red and does not appear clear at all. Be careful not to overcook.Place the whole radicchio leaves around the edge of a platter. Mound the chiffonade radicchio and watercress inside the leaves and around the platter. Remove the skewers from the grill and place on the bed of greens. Squeeze the juice of a lime over the shrimp.*Cook's Note: if using wooden skewers, be sure to soak them in water for at least 30 minutes before placing on the grill.

	"Directions                                                        Bring the pineapple juice and blueberries to a boil in a small saucepan. Cook until the blueberries soften and pop and the juice is thickened and syrupy, about 15 minutes. Stir in the peaches and cook for 5 more minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.Meanwhile, whisk the yogurt, eggs, sugar and zest in a large bowl until combined. Mix together the flour, baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl and fold into the yogurt mixture until combined.Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat and coat with cooking spray. Working in batches, pour the batter about 1/4 cup at a time, evenly spacing the pancakes, onto the skillet or griddle. Cook until the tops are bubbly and look slightly dry, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip carefully and cook until golden and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with more cooking spray and the remaining batter. Serve the pancakes hot with the blueberry-peach sauce.Copyright 2013 Television Food Network, G.P.

	"Boil a small pan of water, then blanch the fennel for 15 secs. Drain and cool under cold running water, then drain again and dry. Whisk together the lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and sugar, then toss half with the fennel. Set the other half of the dressing aside and leave the fennel to marinate while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed pan over a medium heat. Season the sea bass fillets. Place the fish in the pan, skin-side down, and cook for 4-5 mins until the skin is golden and crisp – you might want to press  the fillets with the back of a spatula for the first 30 secs to prevent them curling. Turn, leave for 30 secs to 1 min more, then remove from the heat. Toss the radishes, herbs, capers and reserved fennel fronds into the marinated fennel slices with some seasoning, then pile onto two plates. Carefully place the fish on top, drizzle with the remaining dressing, and serve with Lemon-roasted new potatoes, see 'goes well with'.",

	"Poached Fish Fillets With Tomato Vinaigrette",
	"Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.Salt the fish on both sides and let it rest at room temperature for twenty minutes.Thaw the artichokes, drain on a paper towel or clean kitchen towel to get rid of excess moisture and cut in half lengthwise. Toss the artichokes in the cornstarch.Meanwhile, heat ½ cup of olive oil in a 10 inch nonstick skillet until shimmering over medium heat. Add the artichokes and cook for about 5 minutes, until they are golden.Add the garlic and cook it very quickly, for about 30 seconds only.Strain it through a fine mesh sieve set over a heat proof bowl. Set aside the sieve, since you'll be using it again for the vinaigrette. Place the artichokes and garlic on a paper towel lined pie plate or anything else that's heatproof to drain.Season with salt while they are still hot.Pour the flavored oil back into the skillet and add the remaining ¼ cup of olive oil. Let it stand for about 5 minutes, until the oil reaches 180 degrees.Place the onion in the center of the skillet.When the oil is 180 degrees, gently place the fish around the onion, spooning some oil over each fish fillet.Cover the skillet with a lid and place it in the preheated oven, cooking for 15 minutes.Use two spatulas to turn the fish over, cover with the lid again and cook for 9-14 minutes longer, until the fish reaches 130-135 degrees.Place the artichokes in the oven after you flip the fish over, so that they will heat up.When the fish finishes cooking, take it out of the oil and place on a plate. Cover with aluminum foil so that it stays warm. Turn off the oven but keep the artichokes in there to stay warm while you make the vinaigrette.Place 4 oz of tomatoes, shallot, sherry vinegar, ¾ teaspoon salt, ground black pepper and ½ a cup of the oil that you used to cook the fish into a blender. Process it until it's smooth. Pour it through a fine mesh sieve to strain.Pour the vinaigrette around the fish and garnish with the artichokes, thin slices of the remaining 2 oz of tomatoes, and fresh minced parsley.",

	"Directions                    Watch how to make this recipe.                                                        Pour the wine into a large saucepan set over medium heat. When the wine is heated, carefully set it aflame. Let the flames die out, then increase the heat so that the wine boils; allow it to boil until it cooks down by 1/2. Remove from the heat.Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or large casserole, large enough to hold 6 ribs, over medium-high heat. Season the ribs all over with salt and the crushed pepper. Dust the ribs with about 2 tablespoons of matzoh meal and then when the oil is hot, slip the ribs into the pot and sear for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, until well browned.Transfer the browned ribs to a plate. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pot; lower the heat to medium, and toss in the vegetables and herbs. Brown the vegetables lightly, 5 to 7 minutes, then stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute to blend.Add the reduced wine, browned ribs, and stock to the pot. Bring to a boil; cover the pot tightly, and slide it into the oven to braise for about 2 1/2 hours, or until the ribs are tender enough to be easily pierced with a fork. Every 30 minutes or so, lift the lid and skim and discard whatever fat may have bubbled up to the surface.Carefully transfer the meat to a heated serving platter with a lip and keep warm. Boil the pan liquid until it thickens and reduces to approximately 1 quart. Season with salt and pepper and pass through a fine-mesh strainer; discard the solids.Presentation: Pour the sauce over the meat.

Next, mix the salt and pepper evenly into the flour and coat both sides of each fillet of fish. Then add to the pan, cooking until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and repeat on the second side until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with each fillet, holding the cooked fillets warm, covered with foil on a plate, until serving. Additional oil may be needed during the process.After searing the fish, add the wine to the pan to deglaze. Allow the wine to reduce by half, 3 to 4 minutes, then add the stock and reduce by three-quarters volume, resulting in 1 cup sauce. This reduction will take 4 to 5 minutes. Then add the mushrooms, herbs and garlic. Stir and allow to finish, reducing by half again, a final 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter until creamy. Finish the fillets with the pan sauce and serve.

Have the butcher cut off the chine/backbone. The rib bones look best if they are shortened and frenched, have the butcher do this for you as well.Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Place the roast, rib side down, in a large roasting pan.  In a small bowl mash together garlic, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper and olive oil to make a paste.  Smear the paste generously over the entire roast.  Scatter the vegetables around the meat and drizzle with olive oil.  Roast for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours or approximately 20 minutes per pound for medium-rare.  Check the internal temperature of the roast in several places with an instant-read thermometer, it should register 120 to 125 degrees F. for medium rare.Remove the beef to a carving board and allow to rest for 20 minutes to let the juices settle.  Note: the internal temperature of the meat will continue to rise about 10 degrees.   Remove the vegetables and set aside.  Pour the pan juices into a fat separator so you can use the broth for the au jus and save the fat for Yorkshire pudding.  Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat.  Add the cabernet and scrape up the brown bits in the bottom of the pan.  Add sugar, water/beef drippings, reserved vegetables and parsley.  Season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until the wine is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.   Strain the sauce through a sieve to remove the solids before serving.                                                    2000 Television Food Network, G.P.

Using a potato peeler, cut a small cone shaped section from the center of the onion. Cut the onion into quarters from the top down, stopping within a 1/2-inch of the root end. Place a bouillon cube in the center of each onion, slip slivers of butter between the sections, and sprinkle with pepper. Wrap each onion in heavy duty foil and place the onions directly onto the hot coals. Cook the onions for 45 minutes turning every so often.To serve, place each onion in individual bowl because the onions will produce a lot of broth, which tastes like French onion soup.

	"Preparation                                                        1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425°F. Line a half-sheet pan with parchment paper.                                                                2. TO MAKE THE DOUGH BY HAND: Whisk the milk and 2 eggs together in a small bowl; set aside. Sift the flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and nutmeg into a medium bowl. Add the butter and mix quickly to coat the butter with the flour mixture. Using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour, scraping the butter off the blender as needed, until the mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs with some pea-size pieces of butter. Mix in the currants. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the milk mixture and mix just until the dough clumps together.TO USE A MIXER: Whisk the milk and 2 eggs together in a small bowl; set aside. Sift the dry ingredients together into the bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer. Add the butter. Attach the bowl to the mixer and fit with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium-low speed until the mixture looks mealy with some pea-size bits of butter. Mix in the currants. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the milk mixture, mixing just until the dough barely comes together.                                                                3. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of flour on top. Knead the dough a few times, just until it doesn't stick to the work surface. Do not overwork the dough. The surface will be floured, but the inside of the dough should remain on the wet side. Gently roll out the dough into a 3/4-inch-thick round.                                                                4. Using a 2 1/2-inch fluted biscuit cutter, dipping the cutter into flour between cuts, cut out the scones (cut straight down and do not twist the cutter) and place 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared half-sheet pan. To get the most biscuits out of the dough, cut out the scones close together in concentric circles. Gather up the dough scraps, knead very lightly, and repeat to cut out more scones. You should get two scones from the second batch of scraps. Brush the tops of the scones lightly with the beaten egg, being sure not to let the egg drip down the sides (which would inhibit a good rise).                                                                5. Place the scones in the oven and immediately reduce the heat to 400°F. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool on the pan for a few minutes, then serve warm or cool completely.

	"Preparation                                        For cake:                Preheat oven to 325°F. Butter 12-cup Bundt pan. Spray pan generously with nonstick spray. Dust pan lightly with flour. Mix chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons flour in medium bowl. Sift remaining flour with baking soda, baking powder, and salt into another medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter and brown sugar in large bowl until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in vanilla extract and maple extract. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in flour mixture in 3 additions alternately with buttermilk in 2 additions, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Fold in chocolate chip mixture. Transfer batter to prepared pan, spreading evenly.                                                                Bake cake until tester inserted near center comes out clean and cake begins to pull away from sides of pan, about 1 hour. Cool cake in pan on rack 30 minutes. Invert cake onto rack and cool completely.                                                            GOOD TO KNOW:                Mixing the chocolate chips with a little flour before adding them to the batter helps the chips stay evenly suspended in the batter and evenly distributed throughout the baked cake (otherwise, they may sink to the bottom).                                                            For glaze:                Combine powdered sugar, maple syrup, 2 tablespoons cream, and espresso powder in medium bowl. Whisk until smooth, adding more cream by 1/2 teaspoonfuls if glaze is too thick to drizzle. Spoon glaze decoratively over top of cake; let stand at room temperature until glaze is firm, about 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover with cake dome and let stand at room temperature.",

Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in small bowl.                                                                Peel the apples, cut them in half and remove the cores. Cut the apples into 1- to 2-inch chunks.                                                                In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk until they’re foamy. Pour in the sugar and whisk for a minute or so to blend. Whisk in the rum and vanilla. Whisk in half the flour and when it is incorporated, add half the melted butter, followed by the rest of the flour and the remaining butter, mixing gently after each addition so that you have a smooth, rather thick batter. Switch to a rubber spatula and fold in the apples, turning the fruit so that it's coated with batter. Scrape the mix into the pan and poke it around a little with the spatula so that it's evenish.                                                                Slide the pan into the oven and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the top of the cake is golden brown and a knife inserted deep into the center comes out clean; the cake may pull away from the sides of the pan. Transfer to a cooling rack and let rest for 5 minutes.                                                                Carefully run a blunt knife around the edges of the cake and remove the sides of the springform pan. (Open the springform slowly, and before it’s fully opened, make sure there aren't any apples stuck to it.) Allow the cake to cool until it is just slightly warm or at room temperature. If you want to remove the cake from the bottom of the springform pan, wait until the cake is almost cooled, then run a long spatula between the cake and the pan, cover the top of the cake with a piece of parchment or wax paper, and invert it onto a rack. Carefully remove the bottom of the pan and turn the cake over onto a serving dish.                                                            Serving                The cake can be served warm or at room temperature, with or without a little softly whipped, barely sweetened heavy cream or a spoonful of ice cream. Marie-Hélène's served her cake with cinnamon ice cream and it was a terrific combination.                                                            Storing                The cake will keep for about 2 days at room temperature and, according to my husband, gets more comforting with each passing day. However long you keep the cake, it's best not to cover it — it's too moist. Leave the cake on its plate and just press a piece of plastic wrap or wax paper against the cut surfaces.

	"Place a heavy skillet over medium heat. Pour cream into skillet, bring to a simmer, and cook cream until it reduces by half, about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.                            Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Pour dried ravioli into boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, 16 to 18 minutes. Drain pasta, reserving a cup of pasta water.                            Gently fold cooked ravioli into cream sauce and turn heat to low. Mix in Gorgonzola cheese, stirring gently until melted. If sauce is too thick, thin it with a little pasta cooking water.                            Stir in 2 tablespoons parsley and Parmesan cheese. Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle with diced apple, walnuts, and 1 teaspoon parsley.                                                Kitchen-Friendly View",

On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece of dough into a log about 2 inches wide by 14 inches long by 1 1/2 inches high. Place the logs on the prepared sheet pan with several inches between them.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            In a small bowl, mix 1 egg with 1 teaspoon of water to make an egg wash.

With a serrated knife, slice each log on a slight angle into 3/4-inch-thick pieces, keeping them in a row. Slide the row of biscotti together, lift and place back on the cookie sheet, then separate the slices, leave 1/2 inch of space between each one.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Bake again for 9 to 12 minutes, rotating once during baking, until the biscotti feel slightly firm.",

Editor's Note: Find bunny cookie cutters in the 24-piece Progressive Cookie Cutter and Stencil Kit at KitchenKrafts.com. Mini carrot cookie cutters are available as part of the Easter 12-piece Mini Metal Cutter Collection from Wilton Industries, wilton.com. For a festive presentation, bake cupcakes using regular cupcake liners, then wrap the cooled cupcakes in a pretty paper liner. The ones shown on page 79 are available at etsy.com/shop/PaperNPeace. For bunny tails, attach 1/2-inch craft pompoms with a glue dot. You can also wrap the cupcake base in “edible grass,” usually available in your grocer’s candy aisle at Easter time.
